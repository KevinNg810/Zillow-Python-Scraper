# Zillow-Python-Scraper
## What is this?
This is an ETL program that extracts and parses data from the the popular real estate and rental website www.zillow.com. We decided the parameters we wanted to use were address and price. After parsing the data, you will be able to manipulate and transform the data in python3. Lastly, you can take the cleaned data and push it to the database of your choice. I chose to experiment with MongoDB for this particular project.

## Note
Although, I chose to use Zillow for this project, you can use it to parse any website you like provided you replace html in the get_html function. If you do so, you will have to inspect the website you are using to get the proper references and div tags.
