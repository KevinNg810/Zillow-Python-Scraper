# Zillow-Python-Scraper
## What is this?
This is an ETL program that extracts and parses data from the the popular real estate and rental website www.zillow.com, which will allow you to manipulate and transform the data in python3. Lastly, you can take the cleaned data and push it to the database of your choice. I chose to experiment with MongoDB for this particular project.
